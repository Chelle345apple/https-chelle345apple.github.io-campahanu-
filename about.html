        <h1>Camp Ahanu...The Beginning:</h1>

        <p>Camp Ahanu began when two friends, Chelle and Cass, reflected on the boring
            summers of their childhood. While their parents were at work, they were often left
            alone at home - old enough to stay by themselves but too young to work or earn
            money. Without much to do, they grew bored and spent too much time gaming instead
            of engaing in healhier activities like reading or exploring. Determined to change this, 
            they decided to create a fun, engaging, educational, and safe day camp at the private
            school where they both worked. With fundraising efforts and the support of friends and 
            family, Camp Ahanu has grown into the vibrant community it is today.
